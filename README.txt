Farmer Helper

	An android application that allows farmers living in rural areas in India to get vital information about crops with the only requirement being a cellular SMS connection. The information can be queried in the farmersâ€™ native language hindi through voice, through the use of the Google voice keyboard api. The information which is retrieved will also be spoken back to the farmers in Hindi. 

	This app was a part of the winning project at IBM Teen Hackathon 2016, Bangalore.
